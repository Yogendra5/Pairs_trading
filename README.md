##Pairs Trading

One of the most popular Martket Neutral trading strategy is Pairs Trading. The following project illustrates the use of Unsupervised Machine Learning to provide us with suitable pairs of NSE equities to execute the Pairs Trading Strategy.
Initially, the dimentionality of the dataset is reduced using Principal Component Analysis and then the equities is fed into DBSCAN clustering algorithm. Possible Pairs from each cluster is then passed through different staistical tests. Pairs with convincing P-values for the tests are then considered as viable pairs. 
For each pair, a rolling z-score is calculated using the ratio series of the closing price of the two assets which is then used to generate Entry and Exit signals.
